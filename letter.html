        <h2 class="dear">Dear Akshu,</h2>
        <p class="first">
          On this special day , I want to take a moment to celebrate not just
          your birthday ; but the incridble person you are.Your presence light
          up every room you enter.Today isn’t just any day—it’s the day the
          world was lucky enough to be introduced to someone as special as you.
          And I just want to take a moment to let you know how much you truly
          mean to me.
        </p>
        <p class="second">
          There are days when I look back at the memories we’ve made, the
          late-night talks, the inside jokes, the little moments—and I can’t
          help but smile. You’ve brought light to my life in ways I can’t always
          put into words, but I hope you know just how deeply appreciated you
          are.You’re one of those rare people who make life better just by being
          in it.
        </p>
        <p class="third">
          On your special day, I just want to say thank you—for being who you
          are, for being here, and for being mine to call a friend. I hope this
          birthday brings you as much joy as you've brought into my life.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth">
          Keep shining, keep smiling, and never forget how loved and valued you
          are.
